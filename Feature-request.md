# Feature requests

This is the file we will use to keep track of feature requests. 

### Tutorials
* Notebook example of using Tektronix xxxx together with the Zurich instruments ultra high frequency quantum analyzer
* Notebook example of using Tektronix xxxx together with the Alazar card 
* Notebook examples of broadbean together with Tektronix 5014,5208 and 7000A 

### Broadbean Features
* Nice way of saving and loading waveforms. This could be used both as documentation/repeatability and to build a library of commonly used waveforms
* Broadbean support for more than 2 triggers
* For broadbean to create parameters e.g a setpoint array based on the sequence that is created. Suppose I create a sequence that changes the duration of something in each element. Then it's likely that I want that to be a parameter for some measurement. Broadbean should create sensible parameters with the pulse sequence without having to manually create them later.

### "Broadbean" GUI Features
* Make the "broadbean" GUI support different AWGs


### Other
* Something
